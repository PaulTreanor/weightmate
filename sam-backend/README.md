# weightmate
The backend is deployed to AWS with AWS SAM. 

You will need [the SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html), [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search/?type=edition&offering=community) to run and depoy the backend. 

## Endpoints 

- **GET /weight**
	```bash
	# Request
	curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/weight

	# Response
	{
		"weightData": [
			{"date": "2023-01-15", "weight": 90.2},
			{"date": "2023-02-01", "weight": 90.5}
			# ... more entries
		]
	}
	```

- **POST /weight**
	```bash
	# Request
	curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/weight \
		-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
		-d '[
			{"date": "2025-01-23", "weight": 97.2},
			{"date": "2025-01-24", "weight": 97.0}
		]'

	# Response
	{
		"message": "Weight entries added successfully",
		"entries": [
			{"date": "2025-01-23", "weight": 97.2},
			{"date": "2025-01-24", "weight": 97.0}
		]
	}
	```


## Running the backend locally
```bash
sam build

# Invoke single function locally
# You can also pass it an event with `--event yourEvent.json` flag
sam local invoke WeightsLambdaFunction

# Run API locally 
# Will output localhost port address
sam local start-api

# Rebuild then run API locally
sh start-local

```


## Deploying the backend to AWS 
```bash
# Set your AWS credentials
export AWS_PROFILE ${your-profile-name}`)

# Build application
sam build

# Deploy application
sam deploy --guided # if deploying for first time
# ..deploy options
# 1. Stack Name - CloudFormation stack name - must be unique to account + region
# 2. AWS Region
# 3. Confirm changes before deploy - generally a good idea
# 4. Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation - so SAM can infer required permissions from template + code  
#Â 5. Save args to samconfig.toml
```

You can find your API Gateway Endpoint URL in the output values displayed after deployment.

## Unit tests
```bash
cd weight-lambda
npm run test
```

## Cleanup
To delete the CloudFormation stack and all its resources:

```bash
sam delete --stack-name weightmate
```
